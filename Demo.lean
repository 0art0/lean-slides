# About

`Lean Slides` is a tool to 
automatically generate `reveal.js` slides
from Markdown comments in the Lean editor.

# Use cases

`Lean Slides` can be used in 
tutorials or demonstrations
to avoid switching between 
the slides and the Lean editor.

The tool also features a code action to 
go in and out of draft mode.
